# Profiles #

The profiles can be selected to enforce a certain sort order without creating a custom sort order.
The following profiles are available

  * custom\_1: The sort order I personally feel most comfortable with. Parent on top; some summary info, modules and properties high up; dependencies and plugins in the middle; less used project info towards the end; and profiles at the bottom
  * default\_0\_4\_0: The default sort order for plugin version 0.4.0 or earlier
  * default\_1\_0\_0: The current default sort order
  * recommended\_2008\_06: The POM Code Convention that was chosen by Maven developers in 2008

Custom profiles can be created on demand, if development is encouraged.
